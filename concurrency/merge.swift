  mergeGroup() works the same way as merge(), but is implemented slightly differently.
  It uses one fewer simultaneous thread, but is otherwise slightly slower.

  This function uses a simple round-robin approach to merging channels; if any one

  This being said, the number of threads used is small. If the incoming data is a flood
  through unbuffered channels, this is probably the better bet. Otherwise use merge()
