/**
  Execute a closure on a concurrent backround thread,
  with the ability to retrieve its result at a later time.

  The returned closure will allow retrieval of the original closure's result.
  If the result is ready, the call will return immediately.
  If the result is not ready yet, the call will block until the result can be returned.

  The result can be used multiple times; the original closure is executed only once.

  :param: task the closure to execute asynchronously.

  :return: a new closure with the same return type, to retrieve the result of 'task'
