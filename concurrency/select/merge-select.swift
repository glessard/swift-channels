/**
  Merge an array of Receivers into one `Receiver`.
  Every item from the input channels will be able to be received via the returned channel.

  This function uses the `select_chan()` function to merge channels; it will only block
  if all channels block. While this sounds good, it is much slower than the other merge functions.
  
  The output channel will close when all inputs are closed.

  - parameter `channels`: an array of `Receiver` to merge.
  - returns: a single `Receiver` provide access to get every message received .
