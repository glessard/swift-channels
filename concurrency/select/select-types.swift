/**
  An evocative name for a closure type sent back by a selectReceive() method.
  Upon being run, a Signal should try to resume the thread spawned by selectReceive()
  if said thread happens to be blocked.

  This attempt may not always be successful, but if such cases the thread should
  eventually be resumed, because there would be several threads contending for the channel.
  There are situations where the Signal could be the only hope to resume the thread,
  because it is the only one waiting on its channel. In those cases the attempt should
  unblock the thread successfully.

    This channel is a subtype of SingletonChannel and thus only one recipient will be able to respond.

    -> whatever code sends a notification back must run asynchronously.

    Associated data can be sent back along with the notification by copying it to the SelectChan.stash
    property. This (and sending the notification) can be done safely inside a closure that is invoked
    through the channel's SelectChan.channelMutex() method. This ensures that it runs synchronously
    with any other closures attempting to do the same, ensuring that only the first succeeds.

    :param: channel the channel to use for a return notification.

    :return: a closure to be run once, which can unblock a stopped thread if needed.
