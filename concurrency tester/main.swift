/**
  Changing the various wait times (in worker() and in the workElements loop)
  can illustrate the contention cases for multiple senders and multiple receivers.

  The number of starts and stops of the senders and receivers queues is minimized
  so as to avoid unnecessary out-of-order message transmissions. In the pthreads
  case, randomness could be increased by substituting all calls to pthread_cond_signal
  with calls to pthread_cond_broadcast instead.
